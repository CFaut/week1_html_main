        Liubov Charkashyna is a retired Belarusian gymnast who won the silver medal in the 2012 Olympic games. She
        started training at a later age compared to other gymnasts - 9 years old. She now works as a gymnastics coach in
        Belarus.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has always been one of my favorite gymnasts because of her determination and the mindset of never giving up.
        She was an underdog who worked her way to the top and inspired many young gymnasts in the process.
