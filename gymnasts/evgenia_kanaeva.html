        Evgenia Kanaeva may be considered the worlds best rhythmic gymnast overall. She won gold medals at both the 2012
        and 2016 Olympic games, and won gold at almost every other competition she competed in since 2007, with a total
        of 63 gold medals over her career, 3 silver medals and no bronze medals. Her grandmother was the one who
        introduced her to the sport at the age of 6. She was nicknamed 'Mother Teresa' by her childhood friends because
        of her kindness and desire to help others. She was the youngest competitor at the 2008 Olympics. She now coaches
        Junior Russian Gymnastics.
      </p>
      <p>She is a favorite because of her consistently beautiful performances, which show her passion for the sport. She
        also always took the pressure of being the world champion and used it to stay motivated amongst the fierce
        competition.</p>
