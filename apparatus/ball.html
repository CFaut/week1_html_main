      <p>Ball is by far one of the hardest pieces of equipment to us in Rhythmic gymnastics.</p>
      <p>It may make for beautiful routines but if it falls or drops in any way - it rolls. This causes lots of
        deductions and can cost you the competition.</p>
      <p>Routines often include rolling the ball on and around the body to display skill as well as intricate throws,
        turns and balances.</p>
      <p>It is a very expressive piece of apparatus and gymnasts often use more sad/emotional music for their routines.
