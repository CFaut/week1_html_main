    </heding>
    <section>
      <p>The hoop is one of the most fun apparatus - routines often include rotation of the hoop around the body and
        throws in skillfull ways as well as leaping and turning within or while holding it.</p>
      <p>However, similarly to the ball, if it is dropped in the competition or not caught after a throw, it can roll
        away, leading to deducted points with every step you take. Yikes!</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hoops are now mostly made of plastic so that the can bend a little instead of the traditional wood.</li>
        <li>Measured according to gymnasts hip height.</li>
        <li>They must weigh a minimum of 300 grams.</li>
        <li>Hoops can be covered in customized tape to match the gymnasts leotard.</li>
