      <p>Clubs are one of the most difficult to use - namely because you have to work with 2 pieces of equipment instead
        of 1.</p>
      <p>Most gymnasts incorporate vibrant and fiery music in their club routines as well as latin dancing.</p>

        <li>Clubs must be a minimum of 150 grams per club.</li>
        <li>They are mostly made from a harder plastic and an internal rod.</li>
        <li>They are usually covered in decorative tape to match the leotard.</li>
